<h2>HANGMAN GAME <img src="Images/Hangman.jpg" alt="Hangman picture" align="right" width="24%" height="30%"/></h2>
<p>
  This is a variation of the classic wordgame 'Hangman'. In general Hangman is a guessing game
  for two or more players. One player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess it
  by suggesting letters, within a certain number of guesses. The word to guess is represented
  by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word. In this problem, the second player
  will always be the computer, who will be picking a word at random.
</p>
  <p>The code loads a list of words from a file named <a href="https://github.com/sowmyaneni/Problem_Solving/blob/master/words.txt" target="_blank"><strong><code>words.txt</code></strong></a>.</p>
  <p> <a href="https://github.com/sowmyaneni/Problem_Solving/blob/master/MIT_hangman_game.py" target="_blank">Code on Github</a></p>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The computer selects a word at random from the list of available words provided in <strong><code>words.txt</code></strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The game is interactive; the flow of the game is as follows:</p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
      <p>At the start of the game, the user will know how many letters the computer's word contains.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>User should supply one guess (i.e. letter) per round.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>After each round, the partially guessed word is displayed so far, as well
      as letters that the user has not yet guessed.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    <p>Some additional rules of the game:</p>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>A user is allowed 8 guesses. User will be reminded of the number of guesses left after each round.
        Assume that players will only ever submit one character at a time (A-Z).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A user loses a guess only when s/he guesses incorrectly.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If the user guesses the same letter twice,  a guess is not taken away - instead, a message is printed letting the user know that they've already guessed that letter and will be asked to try again.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The game will end when the user constructs the full word or runs out of guesses. If the player runs out of guesses (s/he "loses"), reveal the word to the user when the game ends.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ol>
