      <h4>INTERESTS:</h4>
      <p>Books. Movies. Fitness. Rock Climbing. Playing with my pup - Archie</p>
      <p>Books require a special mention in my life. I adore reading books. I cannot stress it enough. My love of reading originated when I was 8 years old.
      My parents bought me this big bound book with all sorts of fairy tales that I could not put down. Infact, my mom
     had to hide the book from me many a times so I wouldn't be so distacted. I always managed to find the hiding spot :).

      <h3>BOOKS - MIDDLE EASTERN AUTHORS:</h3>
      <span>I am a middle-eastern fiction reader. The remarkable stories not only offer a riveting,
        touching tale and deeply engaging characters, but they also show the country's complicated and tragic history
        of poverty, invasion and racial conflicts.</span>
